### Why Nexus?

Type-GraphQL is a really cool project, but it follows the TypeORM convention
of defining schemas, in particularly it is very object-oriented by its use of
decorators and classes.

Nexus is similar conceptually, but it uses simple functions. I find this a bit
simpler to reason about.
